# TipJar

Demo: https://rob-noyes.github.io/tip-jar/

We've all been there, looking at the check and trying to figure out what to tip.  Espeically in the pandemic times, we want to go above and beyond for the service industry workers. 

This app is made from someone who has worked in the service industry in the past and knows its hardships.  By having a simple layout of inputting your total, you can simply click or tap the percentage you want to give, or put in a custome precentage as well. 

### Layout

With a simple yet intuitive interface, you can input the total of your check, and tap on the percentage of tip you want to give.  If you do not see the percentage you want to give, you can put in your own custom amount instead.  

### Frameworks Used

This app was made using Reactjs and TailwindCSS. Both of these were the first time I have completed a solo porject using them.  

Within React I was focusing on lerning hooks and useState to help make the application run smooth while also having an organized codebase.  By utilizing TailwindCSS I was able to quickly produce the CSS side, and found that it is a quicker method to create and adapt an app.  

I also made sure to fully uitilize Tailwind with the responsive mobile first design.  I worked mainly in the iPhone mobile environment first, and then created the full desktop experience afterwards.  It was great to see the ease of use that Tailwind gives the developer, especially without needing to switch between a main css file and creating disitnct classes.
